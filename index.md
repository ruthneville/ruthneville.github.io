> _This site is currently being updated as I transition into my postdoctoral role._

Welcome. Iâ€™m **Ruth Neville**, a spatial data scientist focused on high-skilled migration and international student mobility. I am currently a Research Fellow at the **Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)** at **UCL**. 

My research focuses on understanding and mdoelling human mobility, with a particular emphasis on the _drivers, disruptions,  and future trajectories_ of international student mobility to the UK. I have also worked on projects using digital trace data to understand human mobility in response to crisis, particularly focusing on the refugee displacement after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and changing mobility patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
