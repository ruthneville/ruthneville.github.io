Welcome. I’m **Ruth Neville**, a spatial data scientist focused on high-skilled migration and international student mobility.

My research explores how people move — and why — with particular attention to how crises and policy disruptions shape global mobility. Using forecasting models, spatial data, and longitudinal analysis, I aim to support more resilient and equitable approaches to global migration.

Currently, I’m a Research Fellow at **UCL**, working on projects that integrate spatial modelling, digital trace data, and migration theory.
