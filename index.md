Welcome! I’m **Ruth**, a spatial data scientist specialising in international student mobility, high-skilled migration, and forecasting. My research explores how socio-political and economic shocks shape population movement, with a particular focus on international student flows to the UK.

I recently completed my PhD at [University Name] and am now a postdoctoral researcher at [UCL's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa), where I work with large-scale data to understand mobility trends in times of crisis.
