<h2> What is an ABM? </h2> 

<p> ABM stands for an Agent Based Model. An ABM allows a researcher to simulate actions of agents and measure their behaviour and outcomes over time (Crooks and Heppenstall, 2012, p.86). The key elements of an ABM are the model, the agent, and the envrionment. The model deals with the user and sets up the model, running the model iterations and stopping conditions. The agent includes the agent's behaviour and records of their state. The environment represents the 'world' that agents may interact with. </p> 

<h2> GEOG5995M - Practical 1 </h2> 

<p> For my first assignment I was asked to create an ABM to simulate sheep grazing in a field. This was my first time ever using Python, and my first introduction to programming. </p> 

<p> I was successful in creating a model which simulated sheep grazing in an environment with other sheep, with each sheep being aware of others around them and only eating until their stomach's were full. I was able to animate the model. Please see the below static image of the output, which ideally I would present animated here!</p>

<p> Each hexagon represents a sheep, and the blue/green background is the environment. Where there is markings in the environment this represent where the sheep have grazed. When the model animates, you can see that it stops when the stopping condition comes into force as it is unrealistic that sheep would go on grazing forever and ever. </p>

<p> Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/ruthneville/Practical-1-Agent-Based-Model"> my GitHub repository </a> for the final code of the Agent and the Model that ran successfully - "Agent Framework.py" and "Final Model - Animation Practical.py". The repository also includes a <a href="https://github.com/ruthneville/Practical-1-Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/README.md"> ReadMe file </a> and a  <a href="https://github.com/ruthneville/Practical-1-Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/LICENSE"> license agreement</a>. I am open to feedback on the model on how it can be made more efficient. </p>

<p> At the time of writing I have not been able to successfully run the GUI practical, but I am going to keep working on this. I have uploaded the code that I attempted to write to the repository even if it does not fully work as a reference or if anybody has any advice on how to fix it! The name of this is <a href="https://github.com/ruthneville/Practical-1-Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/FinalPracticalAttempt(GUI).py"> "Final Practical Attempt (GUI)" </a> within the ABM repository, the accompanying attempt at the agentframework is also included as < a href="https://github.com/ruthneville/Practical-1-Agent-Based-Model/blob/main/AgentFrameworkAttempt.py"> Agent Framework Attempt" </a>. </p>
